# CSGOMusicPlayer

Uses CSGO's game state integration to play when you are dead, and pause it when you are alive

Known issues
	If you are using spotify and an advert is playing when your state changes then it won't play/pause the music when it stops
		
		Fixes:
			
			Play/pause the music when the advert has finished
			
			Pay for spotify premium so there are no adds
