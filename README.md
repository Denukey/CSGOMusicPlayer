# CSGOMusicPlayer
Uses CSGO's game state integration to play when you are dead, and pause it when you are alive

Known issues:
	If you are using spotify and an advert is playing when your state changes then it won't play/pause the music when it stops
		Fixes:
			play/pause the music when the advert has finished
			pay for spotify premium so there are no adds
